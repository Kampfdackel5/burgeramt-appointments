# Berlin Bürgeramt appointment finder

This tool finds the available appointment dates for the Berlin Bürgeramt. This script does not book appointments, it only finds them and logs them to a file. This script was used to find myself an appointment 3 days after I ran it (for about 1-2 hours).

Use it with responsible delays or you will get blocked. You can also read a guide about booking an appointment [here](http://allaboutberlin.com/guides/berlin-burgeramt-appointment) from the original author of the script.
